# PixelYear PWA

### Tech stack:
Frontend: 
Framework - Vue -> Nuxt 3
State menagement - pinia
Login via facebook and gmail (a little tricky)
Login through the application itself, JWT token

### To do:
- https://dev.to/rdegges/please-stop-using-local-storage-1i04
- Fix problems with `navigateTo()`

### Refactorization ðŸ¤ž
- Break the components into even smaller ones. E.g.: `components/categories/anxiety/inputs` which will allow to use the components themselves in the calendar and in the 'daily'
- Divide classes into global and local to preserve DRY

```bash
# yarn
